# Emergency Communication Platform 
This is a work in progress emergency communication system design blueprint.
`EMCO` for short. It is the abbreviation of `Em`ergency `Co`mmunication

> NOTE: Everything is subject to change.


## EMCO Protocol
`EMCO-P` is an emergency communication protocol designed to be accessible for any type of situations.

Can be used with WebSocket, HTTP Post or radio frequency.

## EMCO Relay 
It's a service (hardware or online server) for relaying and saving messages. Can be mentioned as `EMCO-R`

Initially it is a web server but planned to be extended to work on hardware level too.

## EMCO Client
A Client can connect via EMCO Protocol. (`EMCO-P`)
There are 2 types of clients.
1. Hardware Clients.
2. Software clients.


## EMCO Network (Mesh System)
It's (ideally) a hardware to extend network communication, but clients can be used for this purpose as well.
Bridge devices can translate or transmit between protocols LoRa <-> TCP 
- LoRa => Wifi Bundle
- LoRa => Ethernet Bundle 


# EMCO Hardware
- Hand Terminal (Text Messenger)
- Access Point (LORA To TCP / TCP to LORA) + Capture Portal
- nRF24L01 
- LoRa 915, 868, 433

    },
    e:{//Echo
        //Needs to be explored.
        is:"ISSUER"
        sig:"SIGNATURE"
        //Echo object should contain its own signature, 
        //Echo object should be ignored when calculating request signature
        //Echo message must not modify original request.
    }
}

## Coordinate Definitions
- Coordinate provider types
  - M: Mobile
  - I: ISP
  - G: GPS
- Precision types.
  - A: Approximate
  - P: Precise
  - U: Undetermined / Unkown


## Request Types
- P: Ping
- M: Message
- I: Identifier
- Q: Query

## Echo Data
Relayed messages are called echoes. I need to think more about this topic.

My intial thoughts are; 
1. If a request does not contain a location relay can add it's own location
2. Echo should contain a identifier like: It's hardware or a server etc.



## Short Codes (Needs to be extended.)
- A => ALL OK
- A0 => All good. / I'm ok
- A1 => I've been rescued.
- 
- C => Earthquake
- C1 => Under wreck
- 
- D => Flooding.
- D1 => Flooding trapped.
- 
- F => Fire
- F1 => Place I'm in is burning.
- 
- L => Life threatening situation
- L1 => Heart Attack
- L2 => Stabbed
- L3 => Being followed
- L4 => Need medicine
- L5 => Need water
- L6 => Need shelter
- L7 => Trapped
- 
- W: => Sea, Ocean related messages
- W1: => Stranded
- W2: => Crash
- 
- X: Emergency responses
- X0: Ping
- X1: Rescued
- 
- Z: Emergency responses
- Z0 Ping
- Z1: Request received
- Z2: En route
- Z3: Arrived
- Z4: Can't Find Location


### Mind Map - Topics to explore
- A Client can store, relay, if required add it's own location while relaying.
- Twitter Proxy? (@Mention a relay's twitter account to send message.)
- Tweet ID? Tweet fetcher.
- Heart Beat
- Automated communication (a smart device sending a request detected automatically like a smart watch maybe)
