# Emergency Communication Platform 
This is a work in progress emergency communication system design blueprint.
`EMCO` for short. It is the abbreviation of `Em`ergency `Co`mmunication

All request (package) parameter names are kept as short as possible in order to lower the amount of data transferred. This should be helpful for limited connections.

To make it readable, all parameter names are usually synonyms.

> NOTE: Everything is subject to change.


## EMCO Protocol
`EMCO-P` is an emergency communication protocol designed to be accessible for any type of situations.

Can be used with WebSocket, HTTP Post or radio frequency.

## EMCO Relay 
It's a service (hardware or online server) for relaying and saving messages. Can be mentioned as `EMCO-R`

Initially it is a web server but planned to be extended to work on hardware level too.

## EMCO Client
A Client can connect via `EMCO-P`
There are 2 types of clients.
1. Hardware Clients.
2. Software clients.


## EMCO Network (Mesh System)
It's (ideally) a hardware to extend network communication, but clients can be used for this purpose as well.
Bridge devices can translate or transmit between protocols LoRa <-> TCP 
- LoRa => Wifi Bundle
- LoRa => Ethernet Bundle 


# EMCO Hardware
- Hand Terminal (Text Messenger)
- Access Point (LORA To TCP / TCP to LORA) + Capture Portal
- nRF24L01 
- LoRa 915, 868, 433

## Coordinate Definitions
- Coordinate provider types
  - M: Mobile
  - I: ISP
  - G: GPS
- Precision types.
  - A: Approximate
  - P: Precise
  - U: Undetermined / Unkown


## Request Types
These are the types of messages.
- P: Ping
- M: Message
- I: Identifier
- Q: Query
- S: Subscription
Idea: by adding '@' symbol to the type it can be indicated as test. Might be helpful while developing.


## Requst Query / Subscription parameters (`r.q`)
It's an array object, contains parameter and value pairs.
- before => Requests before this date.
- after => Requests after this date.
- is => Requests by issuer id
- tid => Thread ID (Root ID of an event chain. It is original request's signature ID)
- sc => Requests flagged with this short code.
- ac => Filter by Country
- as => Filter by State
- at => Filter by Town (City)
- am => Filter by Muncipality

## Echo Data
Relayed messages are called echoes. I need to think more about this topic.

My intial thoughts are; 
1. If a request does not contain a location relay can add it's own location
2. Echo should contain a identifier like: It's hardware or a server etc.

## Ideas About Short codes
- First character => Category.
- Second charater => Category detail.
- Third character => Status of the requester.

### Mind Map - Topics to explore
> A Client can store, relay, if required add it's own location while relaying.
>
> Twitter proxy? (@Mention a relay's twitter account to send message.)
>
> Tweet capture => If a twitter acount of a relay is mentioned, location of the tweet & user & situation is captured.
>
> Heart Beat => Telemetry about a person while an act
>
> Automated communication (a smart device sending a request detected automatically like a smart watch maybe)
